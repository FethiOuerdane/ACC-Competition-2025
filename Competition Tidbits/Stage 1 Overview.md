## Stage 1 Overview ðŸ“°

As a registered student team, you automatically participate in stage 1. This is a qualifying stage so please submit your best result! 
Teams will receive access to the QCar 2 digital twin, available through Quanser Interactive Labs (QLabs). The digital twin provides access to all the same sensors and actuators that are on the physical QCar 2. These sensors will behave in the same manner that the physical does and are accessed through the same APIs that the physical uses. 

Teams will be provided with basic scenarios to test their Self-Driving algorithms. These scenarios will serve as a starting point, but it is encouraged to develop more complex scenarios to truly highlight the capabilities of your Self-Driving algorithm for your video submission. Custom environments can be created in QLabs, so we encourage teams to get creative!
Teams will be ranked using the following criteria: 

1.	Readiness of a Self-Driving algorithm based on the core principles as stated in the Core Principles of Self-Driving section. 
2.	Accuracy of driving (staying within the lanes). 
3.	Timely reaction to road signage and traffic controls while adhering to traffic laws as stated in the Traffic Controls Rules section.
4.	Clear and concise communication of Self-Driving concepts demonstrated in the video.
