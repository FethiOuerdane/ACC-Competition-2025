## Stage 1 Overview ðŸ“°

As a registered student team, you automatically participate in stage 1. This is a qualifying stage so please submit your best result! 

Teams will receive access to the QCar 2 digital twin, available through Quanser Interactive Labs (QLabs). The digital twin provides access to all the same sensors and actuators that are on the physical QCar 2. These sensors will behave in the same manner that the physical does and are accessed in the same way that the physical is. 

Teams will be provided with basic scenarios to test their Self-Driving algorithms. These scenarios will serve as a starting point, but it is encouraged to develop more complex scenarios to truly highlight the capabilities of your Self-Driving algorithm for your video submission! Custom environments can be created in QLabs, so we encourage teams to get creative!

In general teams will be ranked using the following criteria: 

1.	Readiness of a Self-Driving algorithm based on the core principles as stated in the Core Principles of Self-Driving section. 
2.	Accuracy of driving (staying within the lanes). 
3.	Timely reaction to road signage and traffic controls.
4.	Clarity and concision in the communication of the Self-Driving concepts demonstrated throughout the video.
