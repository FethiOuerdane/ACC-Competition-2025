## Software Compatibility 💻

<strong>Important: It is expected that teams will use Linux and ROS 2. Any other languages used are allowed but will not be supported. </strong>

🐧 <strong>Linux:</strong>

If using Linux, teams are required to use <strong>Ubuntu 20.04</strong> since this is the Ubuntu version that is on the QCar 2. 

🐍 <strong>Python:</strong>

During the virtual stage 1 students must use <strong>Python 3.11.4</strong> since this is the Python version that is installed with the QCar 2 resources provided. 

IMPORTANT NOTE:  During stages 2 and 3, the Physical QCar 2 has Python 3.8.10 installed on it. This version of Python CANNOT change. <strong>Ensure that your code in the Stage 1 submission is compatible with Python 3.8.10</strong>. Avoid packages that will not be compatible since they will not work using a physical QCar 2 in stages 2 and 3!

🐢 <strong>ROS:</strong>

The ROS nodes supplied are intended for ROS2 Humble.
